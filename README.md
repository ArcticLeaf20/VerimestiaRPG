# Verimestia - A turn-based RPG written in Python
A python based RPG created by Aidan Marsters (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
This game is intended to incorporate turn-based combat, story elements, loot, and crafting into a completely text-based game.
One day, I would like to maybe convert this game into a 2-D game. This purpose of this game is to increase my knowledge and comfortability in Python
And I've always had a soft spot for text-based and turn-based games.
